**OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT**

PROJECT ON CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION  ON MALL CUSTOMERS DATASET OBJECTIVE The objective of the project is to perform CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION on MALL CUSTOMERS dataset WHERE I USED clustering techniques like K-means.

**Key Activities**

Data Cleaning checking the missing values and droping unwanted columns

exploratory data analysis

data visualization


**tools used**

python (VS Code)

matplotlib

pandas

seaborn


**key insights**
* A visual distribution of 'Age', 'Annual Income (k$)', and 'Spending Score (1-100)' in the dataset, which helps in understanding the spread and concentration of these variables among customers.
* A visual representation of the gender distribution in the dataset, showing the count of male and female customers.
* A comparative visual analysis of the distribution of 'Age', 'Annual Income (k$)', and 'Spending Score (1-100)' across genders, revealing any potential differences or similarities in these variables between male and female customers.
*  The distribution of customers across different age groups, revealing which age group has the highest and lowest number of customers.
*  The relationship between annual income and spending score, potentially revealing patterns or correlations between these two variables among the customers.
*  Categorizes customers based on their spending scores into five distinct groups and shows the distribution of customers across these groups, helping to identify which spending score ranges have the most or fewest customers.
*  The distribution of customers across five different annual income ranges, highlighting which income brackets have the highest and lowest number of customers.
*  Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) for customer segmentation based on Age and Spending Score, suggesting that 4 clusters are suitable. The scatter plot then visualizes these clusters, highlighting distinct groups of customers with different spending behaviors and ages.
*  The Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) for customer segmentation based on Annual Income and Spending Score, suggesting that 5 clusters are suitable. The scatter plot then visualizes these clusters, showing distinct groups of customers with different annual incomes and spending behaviors.
*  The K-means clustering algorithm has successfully identified five distinct customer segments in the mall dataset, as evidenced by the clustering results and their respective cluster centers. These segments are characterized by different combinations of age, annual income, and spending score, which can help in tailoring marketing strategies to each customer group effectively.
